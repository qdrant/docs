Qdrant is a vector database performing an approximate nearest neighbours search on neural embeddings. It can work perfectly fine
as a standalone system, yet, in some cases, you may find it easier to implement your semantic search application using some
higher-level libraries. Some of such projects provide ready-to-go integrations and here is a curated list of them.

## LangChain

LangChain is a library that makes developing Large Language Models based applications much easier. It unifies the interfaces 
to different libraries, including major embedding providers and Qdrant. Using LangChain, you can focus on the business value 
instead of writing the boilerplate.

Langchain comes with the Qdrant integration by default. It might be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install langchain
```

Qdrant acts as a vector index that may store the embeddings with the documents used to generate them. There are various ways 
how to use it, but calling `Qdrant.from_texts` is probably the most straightforward way how to get started:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
)
doc_store = Qdrant.from_texts(
    texts, embeddings, url="<qdrant-url>", api_key="<qdrant-api-key>", collection_name="texts"
)
```

Calling `Qdrant.from_documents` or `Qdrant.from_texts` will always recreate the collection and remove all the existing points. 
That's fine for some experiments, but you'll prefer not to start from scratch every single time in a real-world scenario. 
If you prefer reusing an existing collection, you can create an instance of Qdrant on your own:

```
import qdrant_client

client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(
    "<qdrant-url>",
    api_key="<qdrant-api-key>", # For Qdrant Cloud, None for local instance
)

doc_store = Qdrant(
    client=client, collection_name="texts", 
    embedding_function=embeddings.embed_query,
)
```
 
If you'd like to know more about running Qdrant in a LangChain-based application, please read our article 
[Question Answering with LangChain and Qdrant without boilerplate](/articles/langchain-integration/). Some more information
might also be found in the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/vectorstores/examples/qdrant.html).

## LlamaIndex (GPT Index)

LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) acts as an interface between your external data and Large Language Models. So you can bring your 
private data and augment LLMs with it. LlamaIndex simplifies data ingestion and indexing, integrating Qdrant as a vector index.

Installing LlamaIndex is straightforward if we use pip as a package manager:

```bash
pip install llama-index
```

LlamaIndex requires providing an instance of `QdrantClient`, so it can interact with Qdrant server.

```python
from llama_index import GPTQdrantIndex

import qdrant_client

client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(
    "<qdrant-url>",
    api_key="<qdrant-api-key>", # For Qdrant Cloud, None for local instance
)

index = GPTQdrantIndex.from_documents(documents, client=client, collection_name="documents")
```

The library [comes with a notebook](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/examples/vector_indices/QdrantIndexDemo.ipynb) 
that shows an end-to-end example of how to use Qdrant within LlamaIndex.

## DocArray
You can use Qdrant natively in DocArray, where Qdrant serves as a high-performance document store to enable scalable vector search.

DocArray is a library from Jina AI for nested, unstructured data in transit, including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc.
It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process, embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer the data with a Pythonic API.


To install DocArray with Qdrant support, please do

```bash
pip install "docarray[qdrant]"
```

More information can be found in [DocArray's documentations](https://docarray.jina.ai/advanced/document-store/qdrant/).

## Haystack

[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) serves as a comprehensive NLP framework, offering a modular methodology for constructing 
cutting-edge generative AI, QA, and semantic knowledge base search systems. A critical element in contemporary NLP systems is an 
efficient database for storing and retrieving extensive text data. Vector databases excel in this role, as they house vector 
representations of text and implement effective methods for swift retrieval. Thus, we are happy to announce the integration 
with Haystack - `QdrantDocumentStore`. This document store is unique, as it is maintained externally by the Qdrant team.

The new document store comes as a separate package and can be updated independently of Haystack:

```bash
pip install qdrant-haystack
```

`QdrantDocumentStore` supports [all the configuration properties](/documentation/collections/#create-collection) available in 
the Qdrant Python client. If you want to customize the default configuration of the collection used under the hood, you can
provide that settings when you create an instance of the `QdrantDocumentStore`. For example, if you'd like to enable the
Scalar Quantization, you'd make that in the following way:

```python
from qdrant_haystack.document_stores import QdrantDocumentStore
from qdrant_client.http import models

document_store = QdrantDocumentStore(
    ":memory:",
    index="Document",
    embedding_dim=512,
    recreate_index=True,
    quantization_config=models.ScalarQuantization(
        scalar=models.ScalarQuantizationConfig(
            type=models.ScalarType.INT8,
            quantile=0.99,
            always_ram=True,
        ),
    ),
)
```

## txtai
Qdrant might be also used as an embedding backend in [txtai](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/) semantic applications.

txtai simplifies building AI-powered semantic search applications using Transformers. It leverages the neural embeddings and their 
properties to encode high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space and allows to find similar objects based on their embeddings' 
proximity.

Qdrant is not built-in txtai backend and requires installing an additional dependency:

```bash
pip install qdrant-txtai
```

The examples and some more information might be found in [qdrant-txtai repository](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-txtai).

## FiftyOne

[FiftyOne](https://voxel51.com/) is an open-source toolkit designed to enhance computer vision workflows by optimizing dataset quality 
and providing valuable insights about your models. FiftyOne 0.20, which includes a native integration with Qdrant, supporting workflows 
like [image similarity search](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#image-similarity) and 
[text search](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#text-similarity). 

Qdrant helps FiftyOne to find the most similar images in the dataset using vector embeddings.

FiftyOne is available as a Python package that might be installed in the following way:

```bash
pip install fiftyone
```

Please check out the documentation of FiftyOne on [Qdrant integration](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/qdrant.html).

## Cohere
Qdrant is compatible with Cohere [co.embed API](https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/embed) and it's official Python SDK that
might be installed as any other package:

```bash
pip install cohere
```

The embeddings returned by co.embed API might be used directly in the Qdrant client's calls:

```python
import cohere
import qdrant_client

from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch

cohere_client = cohere.Client("<< your_api_key >>")
qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="MyCollection",
    points=Batch(
        ids=[1],
        vectors=cohere_client.embed(
            model="large",
            texts=["The best vector database"],
        ).embeddings,
    )
)
```

If you are interested in seeing an end-to-end project created with co.embed API and Qdrant, please check out the
"[Question Answering as a Service with Cohere and Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/qa-with-cohere-and-qdrant/)" article.

## OpenAI
Qdrant can also easily work with [OpenAI embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings). There is an 
official OpenAI Python package that simplifies obtaining them, and it might be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Once installed, the package exposes the method allowing to retrieve the embedding for given text. OpenAI requires an API key
that has to be provided either as an environmental variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or set in the source code directly, as 
presented below:

```python
import openai
import qdrant_client

from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch

# Provide OpenAI API key and choose one of the available models:
# https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview
openai.api_key = "<< your_api_key >>"
embedding_model = "text-embedding-ada-002"

response = openai.Embedding.create(
    input="The best vector database",
    model=embedding_model,
)

qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="MyCollection",
    points=Batch(
        ids=[1],
        vectors=[response["data"][0]["embedding"]],
    )
)
```

## Aleph Alpha
Aleph Alpha is a multimodal and multilingual embeddings' provider. Their API allows creating the embeddings for text and images, both 
in the same latent space. They maintain an [official Python client](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/aleph-alpha-client) that might be 
installed with pip:

```bash
pip install aleph-alpha-client
```

There is both synchronous and asynchronous client available. Obtaining the embeddings for an image and storing it into Qdrant might 
be done in the following way:

```python
import qdrant_client

from aleph_alpha_client import (
    Prompt,
    AsyncClient,
    SemanticEmbeddingRequest,
    SemanticRepresentation,
    ImagePrompt
)
from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch

aa_token = "<< your_token >>"
model = "luminous-base"

qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()
async with AsyncClient(token=aa_token) as client:
    prompt = ImagePrompt.from_file("./path/to/the/image.jpg")
    prompt = Prompt.from_image(prompt)

    query_params = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "representation": SemanticRepresentation.Symmetric,
        "compress_to_size": 128,
    }
    query_request = SemanticEmbeddingRequest(**query_params)
    query_response = await client.semantic_embed(
        request=query_request, model=model
    )
    
    qdrant_client.upsert(
        collection_name="MyCollection",
        points=Batch(
            ids=[1],
            vectors=[query_response.embedding],
        )
    )
```

If we wanted to create text embeddings with the same model, we wouldn't use `ImagePrompt.from_file`, but simply provide the input 
text into the `Prompt.from_text` method.
